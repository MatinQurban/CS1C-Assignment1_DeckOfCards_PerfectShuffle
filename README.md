# CS1C Assignment 1:
## Deck of Cards -- Perfect Shuffle

1. Write a class that will represent a card in a standard deck
of playing cards. You will need to represent both the suit
(clubs, diamonds, hearts or spades) as well as the rank (A, K,
Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2) of each card.


2. Write methods to
• Initialize the deck of cards
• Perform a perfect shuffle
• In a perfect shuffle, the deck is broken exactly in half and
rearranged so that the first card is followed by the 27th
card, followed by the second card, followed by the 28 th
card, and so on.
• Print the deck of cards
• Compare two decks of cards


3. Print out the initial, the deck after the first perfect
shuffle, and the final deck.

return the deck to its original configuration.
